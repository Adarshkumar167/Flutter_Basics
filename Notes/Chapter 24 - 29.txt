Chapter 24 - Auth Service
-------------------------

Auth provider and auth service
We need an auth provider abstract class and AuthService

Let's clean up our exceptions first

UserNotFoundAuthException

We need an auth user
We shouldn't expose Firebase's user to the UI

AuthUser class 
Authuser isEmailVerifiedField.

We need a factory initializer
factory AuthUser.fromFirebase(User user) => AuthUser(user.emailVerified)
