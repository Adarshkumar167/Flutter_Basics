Chapter 24 - Auth Service
-------------------------

Auth provider and auth service
We need an auth provider abstract class and AuthService

Let's clean up our exceptions first

UserNotFoundAuthException

We need an auth user
We shouldn't expose Firebase's user to the UI

AuthUser class 
Authuser isEmailVerifiedField.

We need a factory initializer
factory AuthUser.fromFirebase(User user) => AuthUser(user.emailVerified)


Chapter 25 - Migrating to Auth Service 
--------------------------------------

AuthService.firebase


Chapter 26 - Unit Testing our AuthService
-----------------------------------------

Unit Testing our Auth Service

TDD (Test Driven Development)
Tests need to always be written before code, not the other way around.

Different types of tests
Unit, widget and integration tests
